//	The essential of problem is not to find the leaves, but group leaves of same level 
//	together and also to cut the tree. This is the exact role backtracking plays. 
//	The helper function returns the level which is the distance from its furthest 
//	subtree leaf to root, which helps to identify which group the root belongs to
	
	
//	The key is to find the height of each node. Here the definition of height is:
//	The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. 
		
//	The height of a node is also the its index in the result list (res). For example, 
//	leaves, whose heights are 0, are stored in res[0]. Once we find the height of a 
//	node, we can put it directly into the result.
